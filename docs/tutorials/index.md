# Tutorials

In this tutorial, we will deploy and run Charmed OAI RAN, integrate it with a 5G core network, and connect it to a UE simulator.

You can expect to spend more or less one hour working through the complete tutorial. It’s a strongly-recommended investment of time if you’re new to Charmed OAI RAN - it will save you many more hours later on. Follow the tutorial steps in sequence; they take you on a learning journey through the product.
